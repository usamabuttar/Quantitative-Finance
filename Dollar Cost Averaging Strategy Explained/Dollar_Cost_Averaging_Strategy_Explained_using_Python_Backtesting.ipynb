    "# Dollar Cost Averaging Strategy Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy where an investor divides the total amount to be invested into periodic purchases of a target asset, \n",
    "aiming to reduce the impact of volatility. This approach can be particularly effective in volatile markets, as it spreads out the cost basis over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use **backtrader**, a Python library for backtesting trading strategies, to assess how the DCA strategy would have performed historically on the SPY ETF, \n",
    "an exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 index.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives:\n",
    "1. Fetch historical data for SPY ETF using `yfinance`.\n",
    "2. Implement the DCA strategy in **backtrader**.\n",
    "3. Visualize and interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries Used:\n",
    "- `yfinance`: Fetch financial data from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "- `backtrader`: Backtesting library for financial strategies.\n",
    "- `matplotlib`: Plotting and visualization.\n",
    "- `numpy` and `pandas`: Data manipulation."
